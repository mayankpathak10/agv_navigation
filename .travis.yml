# Generic .travis.yml file for running continuous integration on Travis-CI for
# any ROS package.
#
# Available here:
#   - https://github.com/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration
#
# This installs ROS on a clean Travis-CI virtual machine, creates a ROS
# workspace, resolves all listed dependencies, and sets environment variables
# (setup.bash). Then, it compiles the entire ROS workspace (ensuring there are
# no compilation errors), and runs all the tests. If any of the compilation/test
# phases fail, the build is marked as a failure.
#
# We handle two types of package dependencies specified in the package manifest:
#   - system dependencies that can be installed using `rosdep`, including other
#     ROS packages and system libraries. These dependencies must be known to
#     `rosdistro` and are installed using apt-get.
#   - package dependencies that must be checked out from source. These are handled by
#     `wstool`, and should be listed in a file named dependencies.rosinstall.
#

# There are envioronment variables you may want to change, such as ROS_DISTRO,
# ROSINSTALL_FILE, and the CATKIN_OPTIONS file.  See the README.md for more
# information on these flags, and
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/ for information about
# Travis environment variables in general.
